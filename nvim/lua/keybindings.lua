-- KEYBINDINGS
-- Plugin specific keybindings are in the plugin's config files.

-- Remap space as leader key. Leader key is a special key that will allow us to make some additional keybindings. I'm using a spacebar, but you can use whatever you'd wish. We'll use it (for example) for searching and changing files (by pressing spacebar, then `s` and then `f`).
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('', '<Space>', '<Nop>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '

-- Remap for dealing with word wrap. In general, the `nvim_set_keymap` is the function we can use to create any keymap you'd wish. I tend to keep those related to the whole editor here, while leaving the ones for specific plugins to their own configuration files. That way if I ever remove or change plugins I can keep my keybindings clean.
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'k', "v:count == 0 ? 'gk' : 'k'", { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'j', "v:count == 0 ? 'gj' : 'j'", { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
